# GetStarted

This is the MODIFIED GetStarted tutorial for [IoT DevKit](https://aka.ms/devkit).

Modification allows to sample PCM 1sec frame, calculate PCM sound level gain and RMS value.

It is draft, so expect dirty code, POC alike.

To follow the original, click [guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/blob/master/docs/iot-devkit/devkit-get-started.md) to run it in [IoT Workbench](https://aka.ms/iot-workbench).
