# GetStarted

This is the **MODIFIED** GetStarted tutorial for [IoT DevKit](https://aka.ms/devkit).

Modification allows to sample PCM 1sec frame, calculate PCM sound level gain and RMS value.
These values, among other AZ3166 IoT kit sensor values (temperature, humidity and pressure) are sent to azure iot-device-hub.

You need to process them as you wish afterwards.

It is draft, so expect dirty code, POC alike.

Happy coding.

To follow the original, click [guide](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-iot-workbench/blob/master/docs/iot-devkit/devkit-get-started.md) to run it in [IoT Workbench](https://aka.ms/iot-workbench).
